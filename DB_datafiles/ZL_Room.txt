1;Finally you are here. It's the afternoon, and the surroundings don't seem as bleak as you had expected. The forest you had treked through seemed lush and full of life, alltough you did notice it getting quieter as you made your way through. The trees came to a halt at the base of a large hill and you finally see it. The entrance to the lair. The forest around you is allmost eeriely silent now.;\N;1
2;You can't see anything.;0;1
3;As you make your way through the pitch black hallway;0;1
4;The murky hallway curves here, leading west towards the pit and north. Rats scatter and run away at the sight of you.;\N;1
5;You stumble into a room as the wall ;0;1
6;You open the door and interrupt ;0;1
7;As soon as your torches light hits it ;0;1
8;A breeze of air hit's your face. ;0;1
9;A straight corridor. You hear soft sobbing ahead.  You may proceed north or south.;\N;1
10;You locate the source of the sobbing. ;0;1
11; The room is rahter samll. But you don't even notice this, as the treasure chest in the middle of the room catches your eye. You open the chest and in it is a large sword. Clearly not of orcish , or any other underworld dweller, origin, you deduct that it had belonged to a hero who had the same quest as you. The sword is of far finer craftmanship than any you ever held. This sends toughts to your mind, tougths that question if you are ever going to make it, since a champion of the level that enabled him to wield swords of this magnitude clearly did not. But these tought's get brutely smothered as your eyes fixate on the cool new piece of matter YOU own now. You concentrate on looking at your own reflection from the blade and the gem encrusted handle, concerns of failure just a fleeting memory amongst your materialistic heat.(You get a sword) ;\N;0
12; You run into orc guards! And they aren't happy to see you! ;0;1
13;You hear noises of a scuffle ahead. ;0;1
14;Stairs leading to the next level of this underground lair open up before you, an arching doorway like a gaping maw swallowing the descending steps. You may enter the next level or move either east or west. ;\N;1
15;You feel a breeze across your face. ;0;1
16;Entrance to second level;\N;1
