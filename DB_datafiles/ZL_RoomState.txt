ID;RoomID;Description
0;2;You can't see anything. You fumble around in the dark and find a wall. You may follow the wall left or right.
1;2;You have entered the lair. The air smells damp and moldy. You hear water dripping in the darkness. Two corridors, carved into the rock, open up on each side of you.
0;3;As you make your way through the pitch black hallway, clingin to the wall as a means of navigation, you feel reassured that this is a fine idea. Unfortunately one's hopes and aspiration's are rarely taken into account with what reality has in store for us. Before you know it, you feel your stomach clutched in the arms of freefall. You hardly have time to understand whats happening, safe from the embarrasment by the obvious fact that you should have not entered a evil litch king's lair blind. You hit the ground with truly terminal velocity. You have died.
1;3;You came across a large pit. It completely cuts of this part of the hallway. You cant see the bottom, but assume falling down it will not be without consequens. The pit's wall's are smooth and don't appear climamble.
2;3;You take a running start and plunge yourself over the pit! You feel really impressed at your jump and bask in your selfworth. But no-one is watching. No-one cares in the lair. This still doesent stop you from being smug.
3;3;You take a running start. During the run, you start to second guess yourself and suddenly a veil of disbelief covers your whole being. "This is stupid" you think to yourself as the pit gets closer. You still manage to jump but it's a half hearted jump, and you smak your self against the edge on the other side. You bruise your self but manage to grab hold of the uneven ground and haul your aching body up. You brush it off since no-one is here to witness you hesitating in life-or-death situations. You take 5 points of damage.
4;3;You turn around to get a running start but slip on the wet stone floor. You fall into the pit, filled with disbelief that this actually happend. Then you die.
0;5;You stumble into a room as the wall you were relying on abruptly ends. As you clumsily grope for a wall to lean on, you feel some object get tangled under your feet and shatter in a loud crash. Immediately you hear a door open and what sounds as a something rushing into the room. There is apparently more than one as they grunt to each other. Laughter breaks out amongst the beings and suddenly your life ends whit cold steel to your temple. You have died.
1;5;A reinforced wooden door stands in the western end of the room. Some vine chalice's lie on the floor. The hallway continues to the north.
0;6;You open the door and interrupt three orc guards on a break! You stare at each other for a few seconds out of suprise, but the orc's quickly remember what their duty was and go for their swords.
1;6;You manage to slay all the orcs, trashing the room in the progress. The room is a bloody mess of crumpled up lifeless orc's. The door is to your east.
0;7;As soon as your torches light hits it, you notice the crude pressure plate on the floor. You have no trouble navigating around it. You may proceed north or south.
1;7;You make your way deeper into the dark and dank hallways of the lair. You are trying to stay vigil, but trying to bee vary of what lies ahead makes you loose foces on what lies on the ground. You trigger a pressure plate, and you hear the trap's mechanism spring. You manage to dodge most of the arrows that fly at your body, all but one that gives you a nasty cut on the shoulder. You may proceed north or south. You loose 2 HP.
2;7;You trot along the dark hallway. You are focused on the coming dangers and try to imagine what the depth's have in store for you and WHOOP you have been hit by a wolley of arrows from a trap you just sprung. Mabey pay more attention next time? You may proceed north or south. Loose 10 HP.
0;8;A breeze of air hit's your face. You follow the source of the breeze and find the wall to hide a passage behind a hanging bed of moss. You follow it to the other side and see something that looks like a entrance to a lower level.
1;8;A regular part of the hallway. Nothing strange here. Moss covers the walls. You may continue north or south.
0;10;You locate the source of the sobbing. An enormous troll sits slumped in front of a door on the western wall, crying into his hands. He notices you but continues to weep, ignoring you. He clearly has bigger problems. The hallway continues north and south.
1;10;You leave the troll behind, his sobbing and weeping getting more silent as you progress. You can't help but wonder what was the deal with that
2;10;You draw your sword. The crying troll never sees it coming, and with one sturdy strike the troll goes limp. The body block's the door and due to the size of the creature, is now impossible to get to. You may proceed north or south.
0;12;You run into orc guards! And they aren't happy to see you!
1;12;You have survived. You may continue east or south.
0;13;You hear noises of a scuffle ahead. As your torch lights the way, you see a tumbling ball of two creatures roughly the same size fighting ferociously. You make out a big cave rat and a goblin. The gobling is clearly strugling to hold his own in the fight and it's only a matter of time before he wears down and faces defeat. Clearly if you dont intervene, the rat will be feasting on goblin tonight. Do you wish to intervene?
1;13;The room is empty.
0;15;You feel a breeze across your face. Something inside you tells you that this particular breeze is not of natural origin. You duck under the breeze and a giant blade comes out of seemingly nowhere and slices the air above your head. You take a moment to asses that you infact are in one piece and thank the deities for this rare sign of mercy. You may continue west or south.
1;15;You see the blade swiping out of the wall. This means the trap has allready been sprung, wich in turn means that you have little to no time to adjust to the circumstances. You do what you can but arehit by the blade viciously to the side as you try to leap out of its way. You take 8 HP of damage.
2;15;You never saw it coming. A trap you so unawarely sprung, the blade you didn't notice, the massive force that of sharp steel that hits your neck. You have become one of the many skeletons of adventurer's that populete dungeons and lairs through out the realms. One of those skeletons that you used to look down upon as lesser heroes, since you your self were alive. Now you know why the skull's allways looked like they were grinning, they knew the arrogance of the living with the great hind-sight that comes with leaving your mortal coil. You have died.
