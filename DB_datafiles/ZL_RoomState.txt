0;2;You can't see anything. You fumble around in the dark and find a wall. You may follow the wall left or right.
1;2;You have entered the lair. The air smells damp and moldy. You hear water dripping in the darkness. Two corridors, carved into the rock, open up on each side of you.
0;3; As you make your way through the pitch black hallway, clingin to the wall as a means of navigation, you feel reassured that this is a fine idea. Unfortunately one's hopes and aspiration's are rarely taken into account with what reality has in store for us. Before you know it, you feel your stomach clutched in the arms of freefall. You hardly have time to understand whats happening, safe from the embarrasment by the obvious fact that you should have not entered a evil litch king's lair blind. You hit the ground with truly terminal velocity. You have died.
1;3; You came across a large pit. It completely cuts of this part of the hallway. You cant see the bottom, but assume falling down it will not be without consequens. The pit's wall's are smooth and don't appear climamble.
2;3; You take a running start and plunge yourself over the pit! You feel really impressed at your jump and bask in your selfworth. But no-one is watching. No-one cares in the lair. This still doesent stop you from being smug. The hallway continues east.
3;3; You take a running start. During the run, you start to second guess yourself and suddenly a veil of disbelief covers your whole being. "This is stupid" you think to yourself as the pit gets closer. You still manage to jump but it's a half hearted jump, and you smak your self against the edge on the other side. You bruise your self but manage to grab hold of the uneven ground and haul your aching body up. You brush it off since no-one is here to witness you hesitating in life-or-death situations. The hallway continues east. You take 5 points of damage.
4;3; You turn around to get a running start but slip on the wet stone floor. You fall into the pit, filled with disbelief that this actually happend. Then you die.
0;5; You stumble into a room as the wall you were relying on abruptly ends. As you clumsily grope for a wall to lean on, you feel some object get tangled under your feet and shatter in a loud crash. Immediately you hear a door open and what sounds as a something rushing into the room. There is apparently more than one as they grunt to each other. Laughter breaks out amongst the beings and suddenly your life ends whit cold steel to your temple. You have died.
1;5; A reinforced wooden door stands in the western end of the room. Some vine chalice's lie on the floor.The hallway continues to the north.
0;6; You open the door and interrupt three orc guards on a break! You stare at each other for a few seconds out of suprise, but the orc's quickly remember what their duty was and go for their swords.
1;6; You manage to slay all the orcs, trashing the room in the progress. The room is a bloody mess of crumpled up lifeless orc's. The door is to your east.
